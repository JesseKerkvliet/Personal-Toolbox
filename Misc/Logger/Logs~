Wrote this log tool, to make loggin automated. 	11 okt 2016	11:05
This will save some trees and I will be able to read it back

Transrate test #2	11 okt 2016	11:07
Merged all reads by pair
10 Threads used
Start time = 9:30
End time = 10:24
Results look okay, I may need to compare with the untrimmed version. 	11 okt 2016	11:10
On first examination, it looks like there is no
change in chimeric sequences (still 28%)

On the log system	11 okt 2016	11:10
I think it is best to start using titles for my logs
As they will have the timestamps

Log System update	11 okt 2016	11:12
I added a blank line after each log entry
to keep things readble

Transrate test result analysis	11 okt 2016	11:25
	Looks like the filtering wasn't that successful.
	Somehow, even more segmented contigs
	were present. I will look into the differences

Transrate absolute quality analysis	11 okt 2016	11:39
	I need to find some kind of benchmark for transrate
	to see what values are acceptable and to make
	a report on the quality of the test results

Transrate Test #1 Results analysis	11 okt 2016	11:42
	Apparently, Transrate provides an alternative assembly
	with poorly covered contigs remove. Might
	want to look into that

Transrate Test #1 Results	11 okt 2016	11:46
	The VV and SS results are not to be taken 
	that seriously, since I only used the reads
	of one individual. I need to pair the reads
	and try again. I will call this TRun1VV and
	TRun1SS

TRun1VV	11 okt 2016	15:04
	10 Threads
	Used merged VV reads
	Used 50AAFPKM Assembly


TRun1VV 	11 okt 2016	15:44
	Done after 30 minutes
	I will wait with analyses until I've done 
	All other runs

Change in plan	11 okt 2016	15:53
	Will execute the cross-form.
	Currently running: 
		TRun1VV-AdF2
		All VV reads vs. the global assembly
